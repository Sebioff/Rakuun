Rakuun
======

A browsergame written in PHP.

Getting started
---------------
Here are the necessary steps for setting up Rakuun on your machine:

1. Install a webserver with PHP and MySQL (for development, we used [XAMPP](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)1.7.1 with Apache 2.2.11, PHP 5.2.9, MySQL 5.1.33)
2. Get the [CORE PHP Framework](https://github.com/Sebioff/CORE)
    Note the requirements listed in CORE's README file
3. Copy config/local.php.sample to config/local.php and modify it. Basically you'll just have to enter your MySQL database connection info
